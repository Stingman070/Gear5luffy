        Luffy's Gear 5 finally made its anime debut in Episode 1,071, during Luffy's face-off against Kaido. Although Kaido easily pummels Luffy into the ground, leading citizens of Wano to believe he's done for, out of nowhere Luffy's new-found powers manifest and he finds himself kicked into Gear 5.Aligning with the Mythical Zoan nature of this form, Luffy's already rubbery body gains freedom and flexibility that surpasses what he would receive from his previous forms, to the point that it is now even cartoonishly malleable, with Kaidou likening it to "something out of a picture book". An example of this is when he took a hit to the head from Kaidou's Hassaikai, only for his head to warp and wrap around the weapon and its spikes, or when Kaidou tried to smash him into the ground, his body was simply squished instead and later returned to its original shape.

Luffy is able to utilize both the limb inflation of Gear 3 and the muscle inflation of Gear 4 without the need to pump air into his body first, allowing him to greatly increase his own strength. This allows him to increase his arm to such enormous size that he can grab Kaidou's transformed body and yank him up out of the Skull Dome. With his enlarged limbs and muscles, Luffy could easily manhandle Kaidou despite his enormous size, swinging him in circles and repeatedly slamming him on the ground. Luffy can also perform the inflation over his entire body at once, transforming himself into a giant of massive size.

       As an awakened Zoan, Luffy is afforded far greater strength, speed, and durability than those without awakened Zoan powers. Most notably, he could fight and defeat Kaidou, an infamous Emperor feared for his nigh-unmatchable might, on nearly equal footing. His strength and speed is such that he can match and soon after overpower Rob Lucci's own awakened Zoan form with ease.[9][10] In terms of durability, he could as well take a direct hit from Kaidou's Bolo Breath attack, only to come out of it barely hurt (despite his body appearing cartoonishly charred) and return to the fight immediately after. This also includes a faster recovery rate, which functions involuntarily, even when he is unconscious.[11] In fact, the physical feats Luffy can pull off in Gear 5 border on nearly the absurd; he can spin his legs fast enough to run through midair while generating enough friction to ignite fire in his wake,[12] and spin like a top with such force that he turns into a burrowing drill.
